<p>I'm Eevee 17! I like playing games and making stuff! I have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Eevee17" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube channel</a> that I sometimes post on,
	but you can't expect any schedule out of me for that; I just post when I feel like something is worth posting. Recently, I've discovered that I love learning new things, so I don't really set aside
	time to do YouTube all that much; I'm just spending so much time learning! Every once in a long while, I'll make a game and put it on my <a href="https://eevee-17.itch.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Itch.io page</a>.
	I have a <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a> account for putting most programs I put out on, though. When I make Minecraft content--like mods
	and resource packs (mostly the latter)--I'll put it on <a href="https://modrinth.com/user/Eevee_17" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modrinth</a>.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what else to put here, so here's some stuff about myself: my favorite color is orange (but blue looks better), my favorite games are
	Minecraft and Pok&eacute;mon Emerald, and my favorite time is 7:23. My least favorite color is what I've always called "poop yellow" (you know,
	like <span style="background-color:#661;">#666611</span>), my least favorite bug is a wasp, and my least favorite letter is J. I try not to dislike
	too many things, but that's hard sometimes.</p>
<p>If you find something wrong about this website, or you just want to contact me for other reasons (please don't spam me...), you can email me at
	<a href="mailto:eevee17.ext@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eevee17.ext@gmail.com</a>.</p>
