<p>I tried making this site friendly to those who don't have javascript enabled.</p>
<p>I know this website doesn't follow modern website style conventions, but let me have my fun.</p>
<p>Someday, I'll probably put some code demos on here (or something to that effect), but that day is not today.</p>
<br>
<p>I don't know what to put here, so here's some photos of cool rocks I've found:</p>
<img src="./images/rocks/rock1.png" alt="Maybe black tourmaline and orange quartz rock" class="rock-image">
<img src="./images/rocks/rock2.png" alt="Pointy rusted green opaque glass-like rock" class="rock-image">
<img src="./images/rocks/rock3.png" alt="Long redish-brown layered rock" class="rock-image">
<img src="./images/rocks/rock4.png" alt="Green, grey,and brown chunky rock" class="rock-image">
