<p><strong>I've decided that maybe it isn't the best thing to publish a journal of what I do every day...</strong> so I've removed everything except for links to some interesting things I did. Someday, I'll turn this into something deticated for that, but I probably won't put anything more on this in the future. (Maybe I'll stick this somewhere else on the site...)</p>

<h3>7/23</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Tried making a custom Spinda Pok&eacute;mon card (<a href="./images/spinda-card-dl0723.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here it is</a>, but I warn
		you: I'm really bad at art, especially with a mouse. I really want to get better, so I might start practicing drawing things more often).</li>
</ul>

<h3>7/17</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Got a Nintendo Switch 2 (played a lot of <a href="./images/boo-dl0717.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mario Kart World</a> with my family).</li>
</ul>

<h3>6/29</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Made a <a href="./pokemon-of-the-day" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pok&eacute;mon of the Day website</a> that displays the, well, the Pok&eacute;mon of
		the day. I based it off of the date in mmdd format and the Pok&eacute;mon's Pok&eacute;dex number. Right now, not every day has a Pok&eacute;mon because that would
		need at least 1231 Pok&eacute;mon to work. (I did not work on my Pok&eacute;mon X playthrough video at all... I <em>really</em> have to get back on that.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>6/23</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Dug up some clay, processed it, and made a tablet (I tried writing a syllabic form of Eevee along with 17 on <a href="./images/𒄿𒁉𒌋𒑂-dl0623.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it</a>
		with cuneiforms. I hope it's right).</li>
</ul>

<h3>6/17</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Played a lot more Satisfactory with friends (we built elevators up to the top of the world and started messing around. Oh yeah, we stuck the space elevator up there too. An
		image doesn't do it justice, but <a href="./images/satisfactory_mess-dl-0617.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here's a screenshot</a> of one small area. You
		just had to be there). (I've really got to get back to editing; I'm a few days behind.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>6/14</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Spent all day making a coaster for my dad for father's day (shhh, don't tell him yet! This was my first time ever doing metal inlays, and while I can definitely improve--like
		giving myself more time, using a hardwood, and using a knife to score around the inlay cuts instead of a pencil--I learned a lot and am proud of it. I prefer to do as much
		as I can by hand because it really lets me get into my project more, and it feels much more satisfying in the end, although I did use a disc sander for the sides and a
		drill press for the circular inlay cuts). (<a href="./images/coaster-dl0614.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's a photo of it</a>.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>5/29</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Found a <a href="./images/rocks/rock5.png">cool rock</a> (I'm not entirely sure what it is, but it may be a coral fossil). (I've added the rock to the site home
		page/index to be with other cool rocks.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>5/28</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Built a nice car out of Legos (I spent way too much time on <a href="./images/car-dl0528.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this</a>, so I feel like I have
		to put it here).</li>
</ul>

<h3>5/17</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Finished transcribing The End from Pok&eacute;mon RSE (I've uploaded it <a href="https://musescore.com/user/100207678/scores/25317460?share=copy_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>,
		and I think I did a pretty good job for trying to finish it quickly).</li>
</ul>

<h3>4/15</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Playtested Tankerbox's 'Gasteroid' game (very fun, you should check it out once he puts it out on Steam or something). (Check out his
		<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYgDaivizX8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reveal video</a> on it!)</li>
	<li>Updated <a href="https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC/issues/MC-256913" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MC-256913</a> for 1.21.5 (I have not been keeping up with this one...).</li>
</ul>

<h3>4/10</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Created a 2 (3 if you include the floor) block tall instant redstone crossing intersection thing using a chunky instant buffer I designed
		(<a href="./images/instant-intersection-dl0410.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here's</a> a screenshot if you want it, but don't steal the credit!)</li>
</ul>

<h3>3/31</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Created the best Trainer PR Video ever in Pok&eacute;mon X (<a href="./files/prvideo-dl0331.mp4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">prepare yourself</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h3>3/28</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Finished my shiny Spinda hunt in Pok&eacute;mon Omega Ruby (<a href="./images/shiny-spinda-dl0328.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">her spots are in such nice places too</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h3>3/23</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Built more stuff in Minecraft with my family (it's coming along <a href="./images/ab-area-dl0323.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">incredibly</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h3>3/22</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Built asian-style builds in Minecraft with my family. (<a href="./images/asian-inspired-buildings-dl0322.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's</a> a screenshot of
		part of it so far, and I think it's looking great!)</li>
</ul>

<h3>3/17</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Played more hardcore, died :( (I probably won't make a video, then. <a href="https://youtu.be/OD2sqrLVZW4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's my death clip</a>, and I'll
		say that there was very little I cound have done to avoid it. So sad).</li>
</ul>

<h3>3/14</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Created a desmos thing that represents a polar function based on the same function in a linear plane (I really know how to properly describe it, so here's an
		example: y = x -> r = &theta;). (I showed this off by passing the Cartesian function through a radial plane and marking where they intersect.
		<a href="https://www.desmos.com/3d/vufxtmlz0u" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here</a> is a link to it.) </li>
	<li>Revisited Gaea (2.0) and started actually learning how to use it well (that doesn't mean I'm good at it yet, <a href="./images/gaea-landscape-dl0314.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">but I can still try</a>!).</li>
</ul>

<h3>3/13</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Updated my Bitmap Vanilla Shader to the most recent version of Minecraft (1.21.5-pre2) because snapshots 25w07a and 25w10a modified some shader stuff. (I'll
		only be uploading pre-release versions on the <a href="https://github.com/Eevee-17/Bitmap-Vanilla-Shader" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub page</a> for now.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>3/7</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Finished up the last few things before the first prototype release for Urbanhood! (<a href="https://eevee-17.itch.io/urbanhood-robin-hood-in-the-city" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here</a> is the itch.io page.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>2/28</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Created custom 3d images for the Nintendo 3DS using blender (<a href="./files/custom_3ds_image.zip" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this is my favorite one</a>. I might actually
		start linking stuff I make here, but we'll see; I have to be wary about adding too much stuff, and I don't always feel like I have a lot of time).</li>
