<p>I tried making this site friendly to those who don't have javascript enabled.</p>
<p>I know this website doesn't necessarily follow modern website style conventions, but let me have my fun.</p>
<p>Eventually, I'll probably put some code demos on here (or something to that effect).</p>

<p>Hey, while you're here, why don't you check out the <a href="./pokemon-of-the-day" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pok&eacute;mon of the Day</a> too!</p>
<br>
